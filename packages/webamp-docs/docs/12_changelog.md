# Changelog

## Unreleased

_These changes are not yet published to NPM with an official version number._

:::tip
If you want access to the changes in this section before they are officially released you can do `npm install webamp@main`.
:::

### Improvements

- Added new [`requireButterchurnPresets`](./06_API/02_webamp-constructor.md#requirebutterchurnpresets---promisepreset) option when constructing a Webamp instance. This allows you to specify which Butterchurn presets to use for the Milkdrop visualizer. If you don't specify this option, Webamp will use the default Butterchurn presets.

## 2.2.0

:::info
This is the current version of Webamp.
:::

### Improvements

- Added new [`webamp/butterchurn`](./06_API/00_entrypoints.md#webampbutterchurn) entrypoint which includes Milkdrop window by default. This is the recommended entrypoint for users who want a fully featured Webamp and are not particularly concerned about bundle size.
- Butterchurn Milkdrop visualizer now always uses WebAssembly to sandbox code defined in visualizer presets. Read more about the security implications in [Speeding Up Webamp's Music Visualizer with WebAssembly](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/speeding-up-winamps-music-visualizer-with-webassembly/#security).
- Added new `Webamp` instance methods:
  - [`webamp.toggleShuffle`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#toggleshuffle-void)
  - [`webamp.toggleRepeat`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#togglerepeat-void)
  - [`webamp.getPlayerMediaStatus`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#getmediastatus-mediastatus--null)
- Add new config option [`enableMediaSession`](./06_API/02_webamp-constructor.md#enablemediasession) to allow Webamp to connect to the browser's Media Session API. This enables OS/hardware level media controls like play/pause/next/previous.
- Ensure the promise returned from [`renderWhenReady`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#renderwhenreadydomnode-htmlelement-promisevoid) only resolves after the Webamp instance has been fully mounted and inserted into the DOM. Previously it resolved after the DOM node was created but before it was inserted into the DOM.
- Made Redux state fully serializable.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix bug where scrolling the main window or playlist window would change the volume but also (incorrectly) scroll the page.
- Fix bug where scrolling the playlist window would change the volume instead of scrolling the playlist.
- Fix bug where resizing the window such that the current layout cannot fit on the page, while also scrolled down the page, would cause the layout to be recentered out of view.
- Avoid a console log from Redux Dev Tools.

## 2.1.2

:::info
This is the current version of Webamp.
:::

### Bug Fixes

- Avoid opening Milkdrop window when no window layout is provided.
- Work around issue where setImmediate was not accessible to JSZip when parsing skins.

## 2.1.0

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed "Generate HTML Playlist" feature, which was accidentally broken in 2.0.0.

### Improvements

- Improve skin parsing performance and avoid Chrome console warning by adding `willReadFrequently` to canvas contexts.
- Define an explicit `IMedia` interface for custom media implementations, which allows for better type checking and documentation.
- Added new `Webamp` instance methods:
  - [`webamp.isShuffleEnabled`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#isshuffleenabled-boolean)
  - [`webamp.isRepeatEnabled`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#isrepeatenabled-boolean)
  - [`webamp.setCurrentTrack`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#setcurrenttrackindex-number-void)
  - [`webamp.getPlaylistTracks`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#getplaylisttracks-playlisttrack)

## 2.0.1

### Bug Fixes

Fixed incorrectly built artifacts.

## 2.0.0

## 1.3.0

This release is far overdue. In the last six months we've made a huge number of improvements to Webamp.

We've fixed multiple longstanding bugs and continued to inch closer to pixel-perfect parity with Winamp. We've added several methods which make it easier to use Webamp in your project. In addition, we've continued to invest in the code by refactoring code to make it more maintainable, and converting the entire project from vanilla JavaScript to TypeScript which should help reduce the number of "dumb" bugs.

See a full list below:

### Features:

- Added methods to the webamp instance to control playback:
  - [`webamp.play()`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#play-void)
  - [`webamp.pause()`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#pause-void)
  - [`webamp.previousTrack()`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#previoustrack-void)
  - [`webamp.nextTrack()`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#nexttrack-void)
  - [`webamp.seekForward(seconds)`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#seekbackwardseconds-number-void)
  - [`webamp.seekBackward(seconds)`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#seekbackwardseconds-number-void)
- Our ID3 parsing library [jsmediatags](https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags) has been replaced by [music-metadata-browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/music-metadata-browser). This means we now support a broader range of media types, and also that the bitrate and sample rate displayed are now functional
- The default skin is now included in the Skins section of the options menu by default
- Implemented the "Options" sub context menu. Click the "O" in the "clutter bar" or select "Options" from the main context menu to see it
- The equalizer graph is nolonger antialiased. It is now pixelated like real Winamp
- Added a [`.reopen()`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#reopen-void) method to reopen Webamp after you've closed it ([47ba520](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/47ba520c2422d8e4842468a32ca13492845183cd))
- Stip diacritic marks from song description so it displays better in the marquee ([2b2598](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/2b2598329d3891ee8a976b8169066586110a767a))

### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a longstanding bug where mono audio files would only play in the right channel ([4fd802](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/4fd802f96efabb98c3c1573819eed37fec630f90))
- Fixed a bug ([#687](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/issues/687)) where [`webamp.appendTracks()`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#appendtrackstracks-track-void) would cause currently playing media to pause.
- Avoid sticking a file `<input>` into the global DOM ([343686](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/343686f7454c4ece95b520fa3ddbf3ecc0198100))
- Fix a bug where tracks dragged into the playlist were added at the wrong location ([b074e0](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/b074e0eff35ac8b1b34efa902681aa19ba2b8629))
- Fix a bug where skin cursors were not being shown for the equalizer sliders ([65bb59d](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/65bb59353dc2da858440a3d753aec02fb771f0cc))
- The Marquee text is nolonger blury when in "Double Size" mode ([4b5320](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/4b53209e0cc0a9e0cd84821d012c1770a940063c))
- Scrolling in the Equalizer window nolonger changes the volume ([48a937](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/48a937da8722ccfd3c2e9df378a847c453c36864))
- Clicking anywhere in a equalizer slider now makes the button depress ([20e681](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/20e6811e6f59e82a5765c38b0b33fbed2eb575ee)
- Parsing of the `viscolor.txt` file in skins is now more permissive, allowing us to support more skins ([0d29ff](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/0d29ffe3f4b20505005346cbc97d0cdf85664619))
- The [hotkeys](./05_features/01_hotkeys.md) to seek forward/backwards 10 tracks now works properly ([7d9ef4](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/7d9ef4287f7294f6bdc1db89b717592cf4e48f17))
- Fix a bug where the preamp level was not applied until you changed it ([f03c88](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/f03c88c6d89fd51cbc0538841bb3227accfa0431))
- Fix a bug where `.eqf` values were encoded incorrectly ([c634cd](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/commit/c634cd8b947e5d2d8b94b38023bc20097737a995))
- Preamp and EQ now boost/attenuate the same way original winamp 2 did ([#748](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/pull/748))

### Internal Improvements:

- Webamp is now written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- Upgraded to React and began using a few [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html).
- We nolonger depend upon [cardinal-spline-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cardinal-spline-js), we use our own implementation.

## 1.2.0

### Features

- Users can register an [`onWillClose`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#onwillclosecb-cancel---void--void---void) callback, which is passed a `cancel` function. The `cancel` function can be called to prevent Webamp from closing. [#655](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/pull/655)

### Internal changes

- Webamp is now mostly built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## 1.1.2

### Changes

Webamp is no-longer rendered into the DOM node you pass into [`webamp.renderWhenReady()`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#renderwhenreadydomnode-htmlelement-promisevoid). Instead, Webamp is rendered as a direct child of the `<body>` tag. The passed DOM node is still used for positioning. Webamp will attempt to center itself within that DOM node when it renders.

### Features

- Allow consumers to specify a z-index when constructing Webamp.

### Fixes

- Fixes positioning of context menus in context menu targets when they are spawned while scrolled.
- Improve performance of CharacterString, which gets rendered on every marquee step.

## 1.1.1

### Fixes

- Fixes the marquee text when the host page globally sets `box-sizing`.
- Fixes the initial layout when the container is not at the top of the page.
- Fixes the positioning of context menus created when scrolled down the page.

## 1.1.0

### Breaking

- Webamp will attempt to center itself within the node it is rendered into, rather than within the entire page.
- Webamp now includes the default skin directly in the JS bundle, so you don't need host it separately, or pass a URL as part of the initialization.

### Features

- Equalizer sliders now "stick" slightly at zero.
- Context menus on all windows.
- Toggle window visibility via context menus.
- Users can now hard code the duration of initial tracks. This saves Webamp from having to make an HTTP request to check the duration.

### Fixed

- Marquee now displays one additional character: https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/issues/543
- Track numbers in playlist are now padded to the length of the longest track number.
- Fix close buttons in Playlist and Equalizer in shade mode.
- Skins that omit assets will now fallback to using the default version of that asset.
- Fix seeking forward via hotkeys.

## 1.0.0

**Important:** The NPM module as **moved** from `winamp2-js` to `webamp`. You will need to update your `package.json` to point to the new module.

### Breaking

- Project renamed from "Winamp2-js" to "Webamp".
- UMD module exports as `window.Webamp` instead of `window.winamp2js`. When used via `<script>` tag.
- Deprecated: The misspelled `Webmap` construction option `avaliableSkins` has been deprecated in favor of `availableSkins`. `avaliableSkins` will continue to work, but will log a deprecation warning. [#533](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/pull/533) by [@remigallego](https://github.com/remigallego)

### Added

- Instance method to be notified when Webamp is closed [`webamp.onClose(callback)`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#onclosecb---void---void).
- Instance method to be notified when Webamp is minimized [`webamp.onMinimize(callback)`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#onminimizecb---void---void).
- Support for skins that use `.png` sprite sheets instead of `.bmp`. This saves 15kb for the default skin on the demo page. ([b88e87](https://github.com/captbaritone/winamp2-js/commit/b88e87b6584fd9db2e2295addab7bba0c1acd226))
- We now attempt to detect mono audio files. Previously mono files would report as stereo and play only in the left channel.

### Fixed

- Shrink visualizer by one pixel to match Winamp. [#536](https://github.com/captbaritone/winamp2-js/issues/536) by [@The1Freeman](https://github.com/The1Freeman)
- Remove Google Analytics tracking module from NPM module. ([aeb9522](https://github.com/captbaritone/winamp2-js/commit/aeb9522a47ac4032f0f73fe7828c3ef01728d6aa))

## 0.0.6

- Added: [`winamp.appendTracks()`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#appendtrackstracks-track-void).
- Added: [`winamp.setTracksToPlay()`](./06_API/03_instance-methods.md#settrackstoplaytracks-track-void).
- Changed: We no-longer try to center on window resize.
- Meta: Added real documentation!
- Meta: Remove lots of garbage from the NPM build.

## Prehistory

In all older versions, the API was not stable enough to merit a changelog.
