Changes by libtimidity-0.2.6:
-----------------------------

* fixed a possibly signed integer overflow with crafted midi files.
* other minor clean-ups, etc.


Changes by libtimidity-0.2.5:
-----------------------------

* allow dual-licensing as LGPL / Artistic.


Changes by libtimidity-0.2.4:
-----------------------------

* fixes to the pkg-config file.


Changes by libtimidity-0.2.3:
-----------------------------

* fixed a potential buffer overrun in timi_fgets() which might have led
  to a crash during config parsing.


Changes by libtimidity-0.2.2:
-----------------------------

* removed DLS instruments support completely, it was never good enough:
  one less thing to worry about. and no, the 0.2.x api didn't change.


Changes by libtimidity-0.2.1:
-----------------------------

* new --with-timidty-cfg=FILE configury option to specify the full path
  of timidity.cfg.  the default is "timidity.cfg".  if building without
  configury and a config.h, you can always edit options.h to change the
  value of TIMITIDY_CFG macro.
* fixed 8 bit output in test programs (use U8 format, not S8), along
  with some other minor issues.
* fixed some minor portability issues.
* added project files and standalone makefiles for windows and mac os x.
* fixed copyright/license mistakes in some files, license clarification.
* added standalone makefiles for less common operating systems e.g. dos,
  os/2, morphos, aros, and amigaos.


Changes by libtimidity-0.2.0:
-----------------------------

* stream.c, api change: added mid_istream_seek and mid_istream_tell to
  the mid_istream_* api. added seek and tell funcs to the _MidIStream
  structure. mid_istream_open_callbacks() is changed now accepts these
  callbacks.

* stream.c, api change: mid_istream_open_mem() no longer accepts an
  autoclose parameter, which was error-prone.

* MidSongOptions, api change:  padded the struct with reserved members
  for better alignment.

* mid_song_load(): options are now validated.  limited the acceptable
  sample rate range to 4000-256000.  MID_AUDIO_U16MSB audio format is
  now handled correctly.

* malloc-safe: upon memory allocation failures, the library either does
  a mid_exit() to free all the allocated memory during init time, or a
  mid_song_free() to free the allocated memory during a song load time.

* the library can be compiled using a different memory allocator than
  malloc. (edit common.h for timi_malloc and timi_free)

* mid_init(), mid_init_no_config(): a mid_exit() is guaranteed upon
  config file parse failures or malloc() failures.

* mid_init(): the library doesn't care about common timidity.cfg system
  locations any more, callers of mid_init() are responsible for it. if
  the config file argument to mid_init() contains a parent directory,
  that will be added to timidity search path.

* mid_exit(): does a proper cleanup now and a reinitialization of the
  library doesn't crash.

* multiple resampling fixes. several timidity-0.2i fixes from the
  onicos.com site (http://www.onicos.com/staff/iz/timidity/dist/),
  as well as a few bits from timidity++. several fixes for memory
  errors reported by valgrind.

* mid_istream_skip(): accepts a long type length instead of size_t
  and returns success or failure now.

* options.h (DEFAULT_DRUMCHANNELS): do not mark 16 as a drum channel.

* read_midi_file(): added support for Microsoft RMID format.

* read_midi_file(): fixed parsing of certain MIDI files with extra
  data at the end of the tracks. (SDL_mixer bug:
  http://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1299)

* read_config_file(): honor the return code from a recursive call.

* mid_get_version(): new function to retrieve library version.

* DLS instruments support: made it a config time option, disabled by
  default, because the code isn't good enough, neither is it used in
  unix installations where timidity is normally needed.

* DLS: a few changes from vavoom svn repository to fix loading of drums
  and somewhat improve the dls instruments use. still not good enough.

* renamed macro FSCALE to TIM_FSCALE to avoid possible clashes with
  system headers. renamed FSCALENEG to TIM_FSCALENEG for consistency.

* support for elf and macho symbol visibility attributes. support for
  windows dllexport/dllimport attributes.

* build: changed DEBUG to TIMIDITY_DEBUG for DEBUG_MSG. made to compile
  cleanly using newer gcc versions, as well as clang. made it to compile
  using C++ compilers.

Changes by libtimidity-0.1.0:
-----------------------------

This version of TiMidity should contain all the fixes from the
November 15 2004 SDL_sound Subversion snapshot. In addition, I've made some
changes of my own, e.g.:

* Replacing SDL types and endian-handling with owns.

* File access to the config file and instruments is done through
  stdio functions. File access to MIDI files is done through abstract
  input stream. Implemented functions to create input stream from
  file name, from stdio file pointer, from memory, from callback functions.

* Renamed interface functions
  Timidity_Init            -> mid_init
  Timidity_Init_NoConfig   -> mid_init_no_config
  Timidity_SetVolume       -> mid_song_set_volume
  Timidity_PlaySome        -> mid_song_read_wave
  Timidity_LoadDLS         -> mid_dlspatches_load
  Timidity_FreeDLS         -> mid_dlspatches_free
  Timidity_LoadDLSSong     -> mid_song_load_dls
  Timidity_LoadSong        -> mid_song_load
  Timidity_Start           -> mid_song_start
  Timidity_Seek            -> mid_song_seek
  Timidity_GetSongLength   -> mid_song_get_total_time
  Timidity_FreeSong        -> mid_song_free

* Most structures and macro definition made hidden and placed in
  timidity_internal.h.

* Results of mid_song_read_wave (Timidity_PlaySome) not
  depends with internal sample buffer size.

* mid_init can accept timidity config file name.

* Added functions: mid_song_get_time, mid_song_get_meta.

* Added examples/tests midi2raw.c and playmidi.c.

Changes by SDL_sound-1.0.1:
---------------------------

This version of TiMidity should contain all the fixes from the
September 25 2003 SDL_mixer CVS snapshot. In addition, I've made some
changes of my own, e.g.:

* All file access is done through SDL_RWops. This means the MIDI
  stream no longer has to be a file. (The config file and instruments
  still have to be though.)

* Replacing of TiMidity's endian-handling with SDL's.

* Removal of much unused or unnecessary code, such as

  + The "hooks" for putting a user interface onto TiMidity.
  + The antialias filter. It wasn't active, and even at 4 kHz I
    couldn't hear any difference when activating it.
  + Removed all traces of LOOKUP_HACK and LOOKUP_INTERPOLATION.
    According to the code comments they weren't very good anyway.
    ("degrades sound quality noticeably"). I also removed the
    disclaimer about the "8-bit uLaw to 16-bit PCM and the 13-bit-PCM
    to 8-bit uLaw tables" disclaimer, since I believe those were the
    tables I removed.
  + Removed LOOKUP_SINE since it was already commented out. I think we
    can count on our target audience having math co-processors
    nowadays.
  + Removed USE_LDEXP since it wasn't being used and "it doesn't make
    much of a difference either way".
  + Removed decompress hack from open_file() since it didn't look very
    portable.
  + Removed heaps of unnecessary constants.
  + Removed unused functions.
  + Assume that LINEAR_INTERPOLATION is always used, so remove all
    code dealing with it not being so. It's not that I think the
    difference in audio quality is that great, but since it wouldn't
    compile without code changes I assume no one's used it for quite
    some time...
  + Assume PRECALC_LOOPS is always defined. Judging by the comments it
    may not make much of a difference either way, so why maintain two
    versions of the same code?

* Moving several static globals into the MidiSong struct. This
  includes sample rate, formate, etc. which are now all per-song.

* Moved some typedefs (e.g. MidiSong) to timidity.h for easy inclusion
  into the MIDI decoder.

* Added free_pathlist().

* Replaced TiMidity's own 8, 16 and 32-bit types with SDL's.

* Made TiMidity look for its configuration file in both /etc and
  /usr/local/lib/timidity. (Windows version remains unchanged.)

* Timidity_PlaySome() now takes three arguments. A MidiSong, a decode
  buffer and decode buffer size in bytes. (MidiSong is a new argument,
  and buffer size used to be in samples.)

  In addition, it will return the number of bytes decoded.

* Added Timidity_Exit().

* Removed Timidity_Stop() and Timidity_Active(). Stopping playback
  should be handled by SDL_sound, and Timidity_PlaySome() will return
  0 when the MIDI stream is finished.

* Modified the ToneBank stuff to allow some data to be shared between
  MidiSongs.

* The following files have been removed: controls.c, controls.h,
  filter.c, filter.h, sdl_a.c, sdl_c.c

* config.h has been renamed as options.h to avoid confusion with the
  automatically generated config.h for SDL_sound.

* Added support for loading DLS format instruments:
	Timidity_LoadDLS(), Timidity_FreeDLS(), Timidity_LoadDLSSong()

* Added Timidity_Init_NoConfig()
