## Predecessors

- [Webamp2x](http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=91850) An
  impressive implementation from 2002(!). Doesn't seem to work/play in my
  modern browsers.

- [Winamp em HTML5 e Javascript](http://www.tidbits.com.br/winamp-em-html5-e-javascript)
  In 2010 a developer named Danilo posted one of his HTML5 experiments: "an
  audio player simulating good old Winamp". You will have to download the zip
  file.

- [JuicyDrop](http://cggaurav.github.io/juicydrop/) An HTML5 implementation with
  less empasis on being true to the skin, but fully featured visualizations.
  @cggaurav is keeping it alive on [GitHub](https://github.com/cggaurav/juicydrop)

- [Spotiamp](http://spotiamp.com/) The folks at Spotify reimplemented Winamp as
  a frontend for Spotify. Not in a browser, and only runs on Windows.
